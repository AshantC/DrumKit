## JavaScript
Used to place images of drums. Used to play sound by making  a function call with the corresponding key pressed. 

Here we use animation when we click each button using JavaScript. Also, we used 
# setTimeout() function to remove the animation  after some time. The code is as follows:
setTimeout(function(){
        activeButton.classList.remove("pressed")
    }, 100);
